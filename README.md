# new_textual_features_for_public_speaking


This repository contains code for the extraction and evaluation of the new textual features extracted from transcripts of speech of performances of speakers on the competiton "Ma th√®se en 180 secondes". 

In the main folder one can find text of the paper (Paper_Draft.pdf) where we discuss our results.

## preprocessing

Before feature extraction data has to be separated on the classes. For that one have to execute code in the file preprocessing/LabelProcessor_MT.py by writing:

" python3 LabelProcessor_MT.py "

Do not forget to specify internal variable rate_type with the score you want to work with.

## feature extraction

Code with feature extraction is located in the file preprocessing/TextProcessor_MT.py. To execute it you can use command:

" python3 TextProcessor_MT.py --dataset MT "

## SHAP values calculation

You can execute learning of classifier and SHAP values calculation by starting code from the file test_MT.py:

" python3 test_MT.py"

Do not forget to specify internal variable rate_type with the score you want to work with. Do not forget to specify the same variable in the feedback/SHAP.py.

## Results

Finally you will have results in the folder results/ + str(rate_type) depending on which rate_type you specified above.
